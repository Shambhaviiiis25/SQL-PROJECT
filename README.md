Zomato, a leading restaurant aggregator and food delivery platform, hosts a vast database of restaurants across various cities.

Understanding key business metrics such as online delivery adoption, table booking trends, customer ratings, and voting patterns is crucial for improving platform performance, restaurant recommendations, and overall user experience.
